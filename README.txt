The aim of this project is to produce an app that is capable of performing a face detection and facial image analysis. 
An image would be uploaded to a client webpage and the server takes the image as an input. 
The server gets the data about the faces from the image uploaded before sending it back to the client. 
IBM Cloud Watson services are used to helped build the application. For this project, two iterations were completed.
